                    <p>Hi there! My name is Jainil Ajmera. I am 15 years old, and I currently study at Delhi Public School, Gurgaon. I was born on November 21, 2001 in Andheri, a bustling suburb of Mumbai. I enjoy problem-solving and have an array of diverse interests, including robotics, programming, web development, filmmaking and playing the guitar.</p>
				    <p>I have several awards (both national and international) to my credit. Some of the more prestigious of these include being ranked 18th internationally in the National Cyber Olympiad (which is now conducted in several countries across Asia) and being a part of a First Tech Challenge (FTC) team that bagged numerous awards, such as the Inspire Award and PTC Design Award, at regional events.</p>
				    <p>Being a member of the Metal Marauders, a private FTC team based in New Jersey, remains one of my most cherished experiences. By exposing me to the various aspects of robotics, FTC helped deepen my passion for the STEM field and turned me into a better problem-solver. In addition, the program helped me learn how to share my ideas with others by providing me with the opportunity to become involved with the community. I am extremely thankful to the other members of the team, who shared their knowledge with me and supported me throughout the season.</p>
				    <p>Building on these experiences, I participated in another competition called World Robot Olympiad (WRO) last year. Our team, High Voltage, secured the second position in the Regular Junior High category of WRO 2016.</p>

Finally, to score points, the robot needed to pick the correct waste, deposit them in the bins, and return to the start area.</p>
