                <h3>Hi there! My name is Jainil Ajmera; 'Jainil' refers to <em>purity of the heart</em> and 'Ajmera' is my last name. I am 14 years old, and I currently study at Delhi Public School, Gurgaon. I was born on November 21, 2001 in a suburb of Mumbai- the financial and commercial hub of India. At heart, I am a roboticist; I like tinkering with electronics and enjoy programming. Every now and then, however, I try to figure out time to support my other hobbies, which include Web Development, Filmmaking, 3D Modelling and playing the guitar.</h3>
