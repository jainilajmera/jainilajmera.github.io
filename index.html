            <h2>A glimpse of my life...</h2>
            <h3>Hi there! My name is Jainil Ajmera; 'Jainil' refers to <em>purity of the heart</em> and 'Ajmera' is my last name. I am 14 years old, and I currently study at Delhi Public School, Gurgaon. I was born on November 21, 2001 in Andheri, a bustling suburb of Mumbai. I enjoy tackling challenging problems (especially the nerve-wracking ones that keep me thinking for a while), tinkering with robots and programming. In addition, I try to find time to support some of my other hobbies, which include web development, filmmaking, 3D modelling and playing the guitar.</h3>
            <h3>I have several awards (both national and international) to my credit. Some of the more prestigious of these include being ranked 18th internationally in the National Cyber Olympiad (which is now conducted in several countries across Asia) and being a part of a First Tech Challenge (FTC) team that bagged numerous awards, such as the Inspire Award and PTC Design Award, at several regional events.</h3>
            <h3>Being a member of the Metal Marauders, a private FTC team based in New Jersey, remains one of my most cherished experiences. By exposing me to the various aspects of robotics, FTC helped deepen my passion for the STEM field and turned me into a better problem-solver and innovator. In addition, the program helped me learn how to communicate my ideas better by providing me with the opportunity to present to businesses and become involved with the community. I owe a lot to the other, more experienced members of the team, who shared their knowledge with me and supported me throughout the season.</h3>
            <h3>I continue to build on these experiences and am currently part of a World Robot Olympiad (WRO) team. I aspire to work at NASA and design space probes that will help enhance our understanding of the universe.</h3>
