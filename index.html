                    <p>Hi there! My name is Jainil Ajmera. I'm 18 years old, and I study at Delhi Public School, Gurgaon. I was born on November 21, 2001 in Andheri, a bustling suburb of Mumbai. I enjoy problem-solving and have diverse interests, including robotics, programming, web design, filmmaking and participating in MUNs.</p>
				    <p>My journey in robotics began when I became a part of the Metal Marauders, a private FTC team based in New Jersey. By exposing me to the various aspects of robotics, FTC helped deepen my passion for the STEM field and turned me into a better problem-solver. In addition, the program helped me learn how to pitch my ideas with others and helped me get involved with the community. I am extremely thankful to the other members of the team, who shared their knowledge with me and supported me throughout the season.</p>
				    <p>My biggest achievement, till date, has been to bounce back from a failed robot run to secure the silver medal among 450+ teams globally at the World Robot Olympiad.</p>

Teams are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots in a 10-week build period to compete in an alliance format against other teams. Teams are also required to make an 'Engineering Notebook' that documents their build season and experience. Res-Q, the 2015-16 edition of the First Tech Challenge, challenged students to design and build robots capable of climbing ramps, depositing debris in designated areas and hanging, among other tasks.</p>

The Regular Junior High challenge required a robot to autonomously identify and locate different types of wastes (denoted by cubes of different sizes and colours) found inside the house, and take them to their respective bins (also differentiated by color and location), to sort the waste. Finally, to score points, the robot needed to pick the correct waste, deposit them in the bins, and return to the start area.</p>
